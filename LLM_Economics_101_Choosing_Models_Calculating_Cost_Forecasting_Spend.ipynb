        "Based on the Q3 2024 data from Walmart indicating a 40% spike in plant-based meat sales in Texas contrasted with flat growth in California, we can derive several insights that will inform our recommendations for a 2025 regional marketing budget allocation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Correlation Analysis\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Regional Ad Spend**:\n",
        "   - **Texas**: The spike in sales suggests that marketing efforts in Texas, including Google Ads and in-store promotions, have been effective. If ad spend in Texas has been higher or more targeted towards plant-based products, this could explain the growth.\n",
        "   - **California**: Flat growth in California may indicate either insufficient ad spend or ineffective messaging. If competitor promotions (like Beyond Meat’s 20% discount) are not matched with adequate advertising, it could lead to stagnation in sales.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Competitor Pricing**:\n",
        "   - **California**: Beyond Meat’s 20% discount could be a significant factor in the flat growth of plant-based meat sales. Consumers may be opting for discounted products over other brands, leading to a lack of growth in the overall category. This price sensitivity suggests that consumers in California are more price-conscious, which may not be the case in Texas.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Cultural Trends**:\n",
        "   - **Texas**: The increase in plant-based meat sales could be attributed to a growing acceptance of plant-based diets, possibly driven by health trends or environmental awareness. Texas may be experiencing a cultural shift towards plant-based diets, which is less pronounced in California, where veganism is already more established.\n",
        "   - **California**: The flat growth could indicate market saturation, where the consumer base is already well-versed in plant-based options, leading to less incremental growth.\n",

        "2. **Reassess California Strategy**:\n",

        "\n",
        "3. **Targeted Campaigns**:\n",
        "   - Develop targeted campaigns in Texas that leverage local influencers and community events to further drive awareness and sales. In California, consider educational campaigns that emphasize the unique benefits of your plant-based products over competitors.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Monitor and Adjust**:\n",

This would allow doctors immediate access to concise historical patient information, thereby reducing the time needed for patient record review and analysis by an estimated 40-60%.\n",
        "\n",
        "During the requirements analysis phase, it was estimated that the HMS will summarize around 5,000 patient records each day. These records vary widely in size, ranging from 0 tokens for first-time cases (like newborns) to 1,000,000 tokens for long-term patients. On average, each record contains about 1,500 tokens, and the application will create summaries with a maximum output of 1,000 tokens per record, averaging 450 tokens. A sample summarized record of a patient is depicted next.\n",
