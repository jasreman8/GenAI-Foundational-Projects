# GenAI-Foundational-Projects
This repo contains all the GenAI foundational projects.

**Notebook 1:** A beginner-friendly notebook demonstrating how to authenticate, call OpenAI APIs, and structure prompts to analyze and extract intelligence from clinical narrative text.

**Notebook 2:** A companion notebook to the OpenAI implementation, this project demonstrates how to run medical text extraction using Llama3 models deployed locally through Ollama, with a focus on understanding prompt formatting and API request structure.

**Notebook 3:** Add analytical notebook on proprietary vs open-source vs open-weights LLMs
- Explains ecosystem differences and tradeoffs
- Demonstrates market spend projections using OpenAI and Ollama examples
- Performs cost modeling for LLM application development
- Includes token consumption analysis for grocery app customer support automation
**Notebook 4:** Introduction notebook on tuning LLM sampling parameters and implementing reasoning-focused prompts
- API parameters—temperature, top_p, n (number of completions), frequency_penalty, and presence_penalty
- Core prompt engineering patterns: few-shot prompting, chain-of-thought reasoning, rephrase-and-respond, self-consistency, tree-of-thought prompting, and LLM-as-a-judge evaluation
